Intro:

We've all been there. A friend, relative, or perhaps a charity asks for help. And they need it cheap. Or they want it cheap, anyway.

Two simple truths about charging higher rates for any service: It takes time to get your rates up. Years. And you'll have to get used to saying "no" more often. We're not _trying_ to say "no," but we must know when to say it.

You're not going to charge $250/hour if you've been a designer for six months. And if you are, wow. You're smarter than me. Why are you reading this? Go play with your speed boats.

Okay. Let's just talk about selling. Let's talk about talking. Let's talk about how you need to talk to people who are talking to you about giving you money.

### Do These Things:

#### Be nice
Be confident and speak with authority, but always be nice. No one has to pay you, and no one has to work with you. Be nice, and treat people with respect. I've been doing this for 15 years, and there's a reason I listed that one first. It's important.

#### Be specific
Be ready to explain _exactly_ what you'd be delivering for your price, and be able to explain _exactly_ what you won't deliver on the project.

#### Put everything in writing
Speaking of putting things in writing, put everything in writing. I can't stress this enough. Never assume that you and your client are just "on the same page." If you don't clarify what they get (and what they don't get), I promise they'll expect more than you're planning to deliver. Part of justifying your rate to someone is showing them, in detail, how much work you're doing.

#### Speak with confidence
Never apologize for your rates. The way you talk about your work and your rates tells the client whether or not you're worth it. If this part is difficult for you, rehearse. Know what you're going to say when you're selling yourself. Know what you're going to say when they ask you about money. Write down your possible replies. Practice them. Use friends and family. Rehearse, and do it until it's easy and comfortable.

#### Don't Argue

__Potential Client:__ "It shouldn't take you that long to build my site. My sister/cousin/friend builds sites. It never takes her that long."
__Possible reply:__ "It sounds like have something very specific in mind. I've been doing this for [x] years. I know exactly how long it takes for me to produce high quality work. I'm probably just not the right person for you. And that's okay."

#### If someone is trying to devalue you, don't help them.

Maybe they're trying to compare you to the rest of the field. Perhaps they've "done their homework," and they just know what the going rate is, and you're too high. Whatever the reason is, if someone is trying to convince you that your rate is too high, nip it in the bud. For example:

__Potential Client:__ "It's 2016, this just isn't the going rate for balloon animals anymore."
__Possible reply:__ "There will always be more than one source for a product or service. I'm happy to explain why I charge what I do, but if we're just not in the same budget range, let's respect one another's time. I'm sure you'll find the right fit. It doesn't sound like it's me."

When someone wants to haggle, the best reply is (always) to (politely) say "I don't haggle." How many doctors and lawyers do you know that haggle? Did you say "none?" Because that's the right answer. And you're a professional too. Remember that.

#### Exceptions

There will always be exceptions. There should be, anyway. Be the kind of designer who's willing to help out a friend or a worthy cause. But there's a wrong way to go about that. And it hurts. But that's another topic. Oh look, another topic!
