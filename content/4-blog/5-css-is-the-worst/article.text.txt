Excerpt:

We spend a lot of time loving & hating things in the web design/development community. There's a lot of hyperbole. Something is the new best for a short while, until the new new best makes it the new worst.

If you build websites, you've been watching (and participating in) a major shift in the way we build. Automation, Preprocessors, Task runners, Gulp, Grunt, Burp, Fart, Yawp. Yikes! Everything always changes all the time. So we evolve.

There's an oddity, however, among designers &amp; developers, in the way we work. We love to love things. Then we love to hate the things we loved. The evolution of a practice into a similar (but new) or a completely different practice begins with disillusion.

"Flash is for animation. It's not for building websites."
"Holy shit. Look what you can do in Flash."
"I'm sick of Flash."
"Check out CSS."
"CSS sites are ugly. I'll never use it."
"CSS is amazing."
"CSS has flaws."
"I hate CSS."
