Excerpt:

We spend a lot of time loving & hating things in the web design/development community. There's a lot of hyperbole. Something is the new best for a short while, until the new new best makes it the new worst.

If you build websites, you've been watching (and participating in) a major shift in the way we build. Automation, Preprocessors, Task runners, Gulp, Grunt, Burp, Fart, Yawp. Yikes! Everything always changes all the time. So we evolve.

There's an oddity, however, among designers &amp; developers, in the way we work. We love to love things. Then we love to hate the things we loved. The evolution of a practice into a similar (but new) or a completely different practice begins with disillusion.

"Flash is for animation. It's not meant for building websites."
"Holy shit. Look what you can do in Flash."
"Flash is everywhere. I hate Flash."
"Tables aren't enough anymore. We need something better."
"CSS is the way to do it now."
"This is bullshit. Every new site built with CSS is ugly."
"Holy shit. CSS is amazing."
"CSS has a lot of flaws."
"I hate CSS."
