In my experience, designers withhold uncomfortable information in this relationship,

We'll talk about why professional relationships with designers seem to be more difficult and murky than those with dentists or lawyers, for instance.

<!--
In my opinion, design is not an ethereal talent. It's a learned craft. It's a definable set of skills. Okay. Let's get started.
