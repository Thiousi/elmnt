Intro:

For the sake of this discussion, you own a car dealership. We're comparing the least expensive Honda Civic available, and the most expensive, fancy, race-car-ish BMW in the whole wide world. Okay.

Text:

#### You're the Dealer

__Customer:__ "How much for a car?"
__Dealer:__ "We sell two cars: a Honda Civic, and a BMW."

#### And here you explain the difference, in great detail.

__Customer:__ "I really need the BMW, but I only have enough money for the Honda Civic."
__Dealer:__ "Okay, so let's talk about the Civic."
__Customer:__ "No. I *really need* the BMW."
__Dealer:__ "Honda Civic money gets you a Honda Civic. I understand you *really need* the BMW, but I'm afraid that doesn't change the price of our cars."
__Customer:__ "The dealer down the road said they'd sell me a BMW for the price of a Civic, so that's what you should do."

#### The **Customer** will go on to list multiple reasons why you should change the price of your cars. Unless this **Customer** is running a worthy charity or non-profit that you want to help, all the reasons are irrelevant. I promise.

#### Here's the fork in the road.

### Fork One:
__Dealer:__ "Okay. If that's the case, then a BMW now costs the same as a Honda Civic. I'll just eat less this month. Enjoy your new car."
__Customer:__ "Obviously."

###Fork Two:
__Dealer:__ "If that's what the guy down the road promised you, then that's definitely who you should buy from. Thanks for stopping by."

###Fork You:
One fork will guarantee that you spend your time working for clients who value your work.

The other fork (and I hope this is painfully obviuos) will be painful. In other words, if you choose fork one, you're forked. Good luck getting off that hamster wheel.

####Cars. Yeah, I get it. That's a cute story. That doesn't help me close deals. Let's step back into the real world.

It's true, I didn't give you "practical advice to help you close every sale." But that's not a real thing. Let it go. The only point of this fake story was to remind you that clients don't determine your price. You do. And yes, if you want your price to be higher, you have to earn it. And you have to sell it. Hey, that sounds like a good topic for another article.
