### Greg Smith would be happier at Zapier :)

Whoops, I just stole your tagline. Okay. But "great artists steal," right?

I humbly submit my application for the position of:
###### Product Designer - Growth

### 1. I'd be a great fit for this role

I'm a designer, illustrator and front-end developer with more than 15 years of experience solving problems for my clients. I've been working with and leading a remote team for nearly 10 years.

I'm currently the Creative Director for a digital agency in Southern California. We're a small team, so I wear many hats. I'm involved in research &amp; strategy, UX/wireframing, art direction, UI design, and front-end development. I'm responsible for presenting and selling work to our clients in every phase.

I've been using tools like Photoshop &amp; Illustrator for UI design for years, and lately I'm having fun with Sketch. But I also enjoy designing and iterating a UI right in the browser with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery. I've also gained a strong working knowledge of PHP from building WordPress themes.

### 3. Featured Project

###### Woodway Products

This was a redesign for an existing agency client. The three most important requirements in the brief:

1. Increase revenue! Incorporate a shopping cart that will allow users to:
    a) Purchase online
    b) Create a printable quote to carry to a certified dealer
2. Pull all product info from a database, and attach a custom CMS allowing client to add/remove products.

The client's previous site did not have ecommerce. Managing a dynamic presentation of their product content, funneling the user into a shopping cart option, was the key to increasing sales. While I don't have access to my client's financial data to offer specific metrics, we have solicited and received specific feedback indicating that the tools we've provided have a been a boost to sales.

My team worked with two key stakeholders in the LWO Corporation in Portland, Oregon (owners of the Woodway brand). We were given their old (non-responsive) site and some newer print collateral as content sources. After our initial research and discovery phases, I built wireframes to define the UX for the product selection process (samples below). These wireframes were built in Adobe Illustrator. I'm also a big fan of web apps such as moqups for lower fidelity wireframing.

The wireframe samples below show, respectively:
1. Home page
2. Product Super-Category
3. Product Category
4. Product page with feature &amp; option selection

Upon product feature &amp; option selection, the user is then prompted to purchase or "add to quote."

I've also included some initial home page &amp; product page UI comps that show a few proposed color schemes. I chose this project, as it was a good example of working out the UX challenges with our client, and carrying them over into some UI options. 

Lately, with the challenges of multi-device UI design, we find that managing the UX and design process is sometimes more successful when done right in the browser. I've completed several exclusively "in-browser" design projects in the past couple years.
