I'm the Creative Director at a small, friendly (link: http://www.buildingonline.net target: blank text: agency) in Southern California. I solve problems for my clients, and I design and build interfaces for screens of all sizes. Thanks for stopping by.

I studied illustration and design at The Art Institute of Southern California, now called (link: http://www.lcad.edu text: The Laguna College of Art &amp; Design).

I fell in (and then out of) love with Flash, and now I feel fortunate to work in an environment where multi-device constraints are pushing us to focus on things like page weight and simple content readability again.

I'm an accomplished oil painter, although I do most of my illustrating these days with a Wacom tablet. I studied improv &amp; sketch comedy writing for a few years at the Groundlings school in Los Angeles, because I thought it would be a fun thing to do (it was).

I'm curating a very trimmed-down portfolio these days. With this iteration of my site, I'm putting more focus on writing about our industry.
